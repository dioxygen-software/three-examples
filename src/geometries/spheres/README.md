# Sphere geometries
3 different meshes for modelling spheres as new geometric primitives for THREE.JS.

The different meshes are the following (with their related Buffer Geometry):
* Rounded Cube (RoundedCubeBufferGeometry)
* Spherified Cube (SpherifiedCubeBufferGeometry)
* Icosahedron (IcosahedronSphereBufferGeometry)

The rounded cube is made by normalizing a cube.

The spherified cube is an improved version of the rounded cube.

For the icosahedron, we use the one from three.js (see https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/IcosahedronBufferGeometry).
